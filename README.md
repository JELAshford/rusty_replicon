# A very Rusty Replicator
A reimplementation of "Replicon" (Gindin et. al. 2014) as Rust programming practice, based on the [original](https://doi.org/10.1002/msb.134859) [works](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2014.00378). 

So far, the basic simulation is completed and I'm generating a IPLS for the MCF-7 data from [the Hansen paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0912402107).
